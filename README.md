<strong>Asynchronous programming
</strong>  is a technique that enables your program to start a potentially long-running task, and then rather than having to wait until that task has finished, to be able to continue to be responsive to other events while the task runs.</em><br>

<strong>JDjango JsonResponse
</strong>
<br>
JsonResponse is an HttpResponse subclass that helps to create a JSON-encoded response. Its default Content-Type header is set to application/json. The first parameter, data , should be a dict instance. If the safe parameter is set to False, any object can be passed for serialization; otherwise only dict instances are allowed.
